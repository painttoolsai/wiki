SAI 2 includes native perspective ruler tools for accurate architectural and environmental artwork.

Creating Perspective Rulers
===========================

1. Select **Layer** → **New Layer** → **Perspective Ruler**
2. Choose perspective type:

   * **1-Point** - Single vanishing point (hallways, roads)
   * **2-Point** - Two vanishing points (buildings, boxes)
   * **3-Point** - Three vanishing points (extreme angles)

Using the Ruler
===============

Once created:

1. Your brush strokes snap to perspective lines
2. Drag vanishing points to adjust
3. Use with any brush tool

Vanishing Point Controls
------------------------

* Click and drag to move vanishing points
* Hold Shift for constrained movement
* Right-click for options menu

Tips
====

* Place vanishing points off-canvas for subtle perspective
* Use 2-point for most architectural work
* 3-point creates dramatic bird's eye or worm's eye views

.. tip::
   Create the ruler on a separate layer so you can hide it when not needed.

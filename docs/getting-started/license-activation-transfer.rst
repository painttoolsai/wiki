This guide covers license activation for both Paint Tool SAI Ver.1 and Ver.2, including how to transfer your license to a new computer.

.. important::
   Users with a **SAI Ver.1 license** can use it to unlock save/load functionality in SAI Ver.2 at no additional cost.

Understanding SAI Licensing
===========================

Paint Tool SAI uses a **system-specific licensing model**:

* Each license is tied to a unique **System ID**
* Licenses are delivered as **certificate files**
* You can transfer your license by requesting a new certificate
* Ver.1 license holders get Ver.2 access included

License Types
=============

SAI Ver.1 License
-----------------

* One-time purchase
* Unlimited updates within Ver.1
* **Includes Ver.2 access** - Unlocks save/load in SAI 2
* System-specific certificate

SAI Ver.2 License
-----------------

* Separate purchase from Ver.1
* Full Ver.2 feature access
* Required only if you don't own Ver.1

.. tip::
   If you already own Ver.1, you do **not** need to purchase Ver.2 separately.

First-Time Activation
=====================

Step 1: Obtain Your System ID
-----------------------------

1. Launch Paint Tool SAI (Ver.1 or Ver.2)
2. The **System ID** is displayed:
   
   * Ver.1: During first launch or in Help → About
   * Ver.2: On the startup splash screen

3. Copy or write down the complete System ID

.. note::
   The System ID is unique to your computer hardware. It will change if you make significant hardware modifications.

Step 2: Purchase a License

1. Visit the `SYSTEMAX official website <https://www.systemax.jp/en/sai/>`_
2. Navigate to the purchase page
3. Complete your purchase with your preferred payment method
4. Save your order confirmation and credentials

Step 3: Request Your Certificate

Transferring Your License
=========================

When you need to move your license to a new computer:

Before You Transfer
-------------------

* You can only have **one active license** per purchase
* Transferring deactivates the old computer
* Keep your purchase credentials safe

Transfer Process
----------------

1. **On your new computer:**
   
   * Install SAI
   * Note the new System ID

2. **On the SYSTEMAX website:**
   
   * Log in to your account
   * Navigate to license management
   * Request a new certificate for your new System ID

3. **Install the new certificate:**
   
   * Download the new certificate
   * Copy to SAI installation folder
   * Restart SAI

.. warning::
   After transfer, your old computer will no longer be licensed. You'll need to transfer again to use it.

Using Ver.1 License for Ver.2
=============================

If you own a Ver.1 license and want to use Ver.2:

1. Install SAI Ver.2 (Technical Preview)
2. Note the **Ver.2 System ID** (different from Ver.1)
3. Log in to SYSTEMAX with your Ver.1 credentials
4. Request a Ver.2 certificate using your Ver.2 System ID
5. Install the certificate in your Ver.2 folder

.. tip::
   You can have both Ver.1 and Ver.2 licensed on the same computer, each with their own certificate.

Troubleshooting License Issues
==============================

"Invalid License" Error
-----------------------

**Possible causes:**

* Certificate is in the wrong folder
* System ID has changed (hardware modification)
* Certificate was generated for a different System ID

**Solutions:**

1. Verify certificate is in the SAI installation folder
2. Check if System ID matches the certificate
3. Re-download certificate with current System ID

Can't Download Certificate
--------------------------

**Check:**

* Purchase credentials are correct
* Account is in good standing
* System ID is entered exactly (no typos)

If problems persist, contact SYSTEMAX support.

* Changing primary hard drive

**Solution:** Request a new certificate with your new System ID.
